# Simple data analysis of economic data of the most important countries (project for college)

## Project goal
The goal of the project is to analyze and visualize the most important economic data from the most influential countries in the world. The project aims to understand the relationships and trends occurring in the global economy.

## Data source
Data from a CSV file containing key indicators for over 200 countries were used. The analysis is based on a set of economic data, which include information on GDP, public debt, energy consumption, population, labor force, unemployment rate, and HIV/AIDS prevalence.

## Solutions used
 - Jupyter Notebook
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - NumPy

## Analysis results
The data analysis focused on comparing several key economic indicators for the most influential countries. The main results are presented below:

 - Comparison of GDP and Public Debt: Bar charts were generated to compare GDP and the percentage of public debt to GDP for the 15 largest countries in terms of GDP. It was found that Japan and Italy have the highest percentage of public debt to GDP, while the United States has the highest nominal GDP.
 - Comparison of Energy Consumption and Population: Pie charts were generated to compare energy consumption and population for the United States, the European Union, and China. The analysis showed that China, despite having the largest population, consumes the least amount of energy compared to the US and the EU.
 - Correlation between GDP per capita and HIV/AIDS Prevalence: A correlation matrix was generated to examine the relationship between GDP per capita and HIV/AIDS prevalence in the 50 poorest countries. A weak negative correlation was found between GDP per capita and HIV/AIDS prevalence.
 - Ranking of Countries by Population Size: A ranking of countries by population size, their labor force, and unemployment rate was presented. It was noted that many developing countries have a high unemployment rate.

## Conclusion
 - There is a diversity between countries in terms of economic indicators, and the analysis of these data can provide valuable information on the economic situation of individual countries.
 - Correlations between different economic indicators may indicate the existence of causal or other dependencies between them.
 - Data analysis can help identify areas that require further research or policy intervention to improve the economic situation.
